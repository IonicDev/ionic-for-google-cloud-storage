# Ionic Data Trust for Cloud Services -  GCS 

The Ionic Protect for Google Cloud integration offers a simple way for developers building atop Google's Java SDK to invoke Ionic's protection and policy functionality as data moves to and from the cloud storage. This addresses use cases such as migration from on-prem storage solutions, protecting data across multi-region or multi-cloud environments, applying granular cryptographic control, and more.
